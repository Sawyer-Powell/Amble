# What is Amble?

Amble is an information management system, allowing you to integrate 
information from various different sources into a single format, 
providing powerful programming tools for viewing and manipulating that information.

Amble is designed to work well for individuals and small businesses that want a 
central way to manage all of their information. One that provides convenience without
sacrificing their control, or their privacy.

## Problems that Amble is trying to solve:
- *Note taking and Task management*
  Amble was motivated by the need for a better way to integrate the notes you take on your computer
  with the rest of the information on your computer. Power users often have trouble with current
  software offerings that fragment their data across apps and services. Amble provides a plugin for
  Neovim (Emacs and web versions planned to come later), that allows users to interact with their Amble data
  in Markdown and Org mode, making Amble a natural alternative to existing note taking/knowledge management systems.
- *Integrating information from distinct sources into a common format and interface*
  Amble aims to make it easy to aggregate data, reformatting it in useful ways
  using an intuitive and powerful pattern matching system.
- *Quickly developing UIs for viewing and manipulating information*
  Amble converts information from sources into an intermediate representation called `AIR` (Amble Intermediate Representation).
  Amble then supports rendering that information into formats that can be useful for a web platform, like JSON.
